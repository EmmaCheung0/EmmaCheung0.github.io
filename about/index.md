Looking for a summer internship as a data/finance analyst

## About Me

Hi, I am Lanzhen Zhang. I can go by Emma.

Currently, I am a master student in __applied analytics__ at __Columbia University__. Our program is a composite of data science and business management. I received my undergraduate degree from __Chinese University of Hong Kong__ where I majored in __finance__ and double majored in __statistics__.

I like data, including manipulating it, modeling it, making it (simulation), visualizing it and yes, even cleaning it. I do these things with some combination of __R__, __Python__, and __Sql__. I also like finance. Following the market dynamics, researching the firms and industries, studying the investment strategies, building financial models, and even communicating with talents in this field would make me excited and passionate. I have been very lucky to work in many different realms in financial industry, including as __IB, S&T, Quant, and Research__. 

I know it is more common to follow an unique direction and build my career. But I am really glad that I have experienced those aspects and explored my own interests. I love study new things and I never set limits on my possibilities. I am now pursing the applied analytics program since I would like to acquire and apply more advanced analysis and quantitative skills into the fun finance and technology world.

Outside of the work and study, I love ball games and outdoor sports. I like volleyball, basketball, tennis, badminton, hiking, snowbording, swimming, and wandering around parks or musuems. During my college days, I went hiking and played volleyball every week. And when staying at home like in the quarantine period for coronavirus, I prefer reading, movies and cooking. Lol my hobbies vary...

My goal of establishing this blog is to create a place to store my knowledge, to share my experience, to inspire both you and me to explore and to talk anything. If you are interested in it, please feel free to contact me.

Have a nice day!
