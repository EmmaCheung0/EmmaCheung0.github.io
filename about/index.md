I have been extremely lucky to work in many different realms in financial industry, including as 

I like data. Manipulating it, modeling it, making it (simulation), visualizing it and yes, even cleaning it. I do these things with some combination of __R__, __Python__, and __Javascript__ (d3.js in particular). Most recently I have been fascinated with conveying complex statistical topics and methods using [intuitive](http://nickstrayer.me/binomialFun/confidenceIntervals) and [interactive](http://nickstrayer.me/likelihood) [graphics.](http://nickstrayer.me/binomialFun/)

Besides, I really like outdoor sports and ball games. 

Have a nice day!
